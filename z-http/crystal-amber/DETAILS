Amber is a web application framework written in Crystal inspired
by Kemal, Rails, Phoenix and other popular application frameworks.

The purpose of Amber is not to create yet another framework, but to take
advantage of the beautiful Crystal language capabilities and provide engineers
and the Crystal community with an efficient, cohesive, well maintained web
framework that embraces the language philosophies, conventions, and guidelines.

Amber borrows concepts that have already been battle tested and successful,
and embraces new concepts through team and community collaboration
and analysis, which also aligns with Crystal's philosophy.
