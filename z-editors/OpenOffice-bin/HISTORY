	* After spending weeks attempting to build OpenOffice, I 
	  decided to just go get the binary. This spell is heading 
	  straight to z-rejected.

	* Applied patches (except for gcc3 related) located at 
	  http://www.linux-debian.de/openoffice/, thanks to Yoav 
	  Avitzour <avitzour@princeton.edu> for pointing me here.

	* Modified DETAILS (finally figured this out ;) to have 
	  gpc as SOURCE2, rather than creating a whole other spell 
	  for 2 header files that just need to be copied for OpenOffice.
	* Found that if I have an "_" in my SOURCE (and probably any others), 
	  I must use the escape sequence "\" before it for it to read 
	  (e.g.  SOURCE=oo_$VERSION_src.tar.bz2 -> SOURCE=oo\_$VERSION\_src.tar.bz2)
