These packages contain Broadcom's IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n hybrid Linux device driver
for use with Broadcom's BCM4311-, BCM4312-, BCM4321-, and BCM4322-based
hardware.

The hybrid binary file is agnostic to the specific version of the Linux kernel
because it is designed to perform all interactions with the operating system
through operating-system-specific files and an operating system abstraction
layer file. All Linux operating-system-specific code is provided in source
form, making it possible to retarget to different kernel versions and fix
operating system related issues.
