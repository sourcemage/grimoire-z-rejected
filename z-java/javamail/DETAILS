The JavaMail API provides a set of abstract classes that model a mail system. 
The API provides a platform independent and protocol independent framework to 
build Java technology-based mail and messaging applications. The JavaMail API
is implemented as a Java platform optional package and is also available as 
part of the Java 2 platform, Enterprise Edition. Sun provides a royalty-free
reference implementation, in binary form, that developers will be able to use
and ship.
