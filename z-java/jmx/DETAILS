 Java Management Extensions (JMX) represent a universal, open technology 
 for management, and monitoring ready to be deployed across all industries, 
 wherever management and/or monitoring is/are or will be needed. By design, 
 this new standard is suitable for adapting legacy systems, implementing 
 new management and monitoring solutions and plugging into those of the 
 future.
 
 JMX technology is the definitive means for Java management and monitoring: 
 JMX technology provides the tools for building distributed, Web-based, 
 modular and dynamic solutions for managing and monitoring devices, 
 applications and service-driven networks.
 
 Java Management Extensions is an optional package addition to the 
 J2SE platform.
