cat << EOF
The Java Dynamic Management Kit (Java DMK) is a Java application 
programming interface (API) and a set of development tools for 
designing and implementing a new generation of management 
applications. As an implementation of the Java Management Extensions 
(the JMXTM specification), the product provides a framework for the 
management of Java objects through Java technology-based applications.

The Java DMK provides a complete architecture for designing distributed 
management systems. A Java technology-based solution can embed management
intelligence into your agents, provide an abstraction of your communication
layer, and be upgraded and extended dynamically. Your management 
applications can also take advantage of other Java APIs such as Swing 
components for user interfaces and the JDBCTM API for database access.

In addition, the Java DMK provides a complete toolkit for the simple 
network management protocol (SNMP), the most widespread legacy architecture
for network and device management. This gives you the advantages of 
developing both Java dynamic management agents and managers that can 
interoperate with existing management systems.
