Bugdom is a 1999 Macintosh game by Pangea Software.
You play as Rollie McFly, a pill bug on a quest to save ladybugs
from King Thorax’s iron grip on the Bugdom.

The game was bundled with some Mac models of the era.
It is probably the most advanced game that uses QuickDraw 3D.
Unfortunately, QuickDraw 3D has not been updated past Mac OS 9,
so experiencing the game used to require booting a
PowerPC Mac into OS 9 — until this port came out.

This port aims to provide the best way to experience Bugdom today.
It introduces some modern comforts (such as support for arbitrary resolutions)
and fixes some gameplay bugs. The overall experience is intended to be faithful
to the spirit of the original game, so modifications to the game’s design
are out of the scope of this project.
